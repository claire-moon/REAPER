# Agent Reference - REAPER Project

## Project Overview
- **Name**: REAPER
- **Base Engine**: PsyDoom (reverse-engineered PSX Doom)
- **Goal**: Standalone FPS game with 100% custom assets
- **Architecture**: Hybrid C (game logic) + C++ (renderer)
- **Aesthetic**: PSX hardware limitations for authentic retro feel

## Recent Changes

### README.md Rewrite (2026-02-02)
- README.md has been completely rewritten to reflect REAPER's identity as a standalone game
- All PsyDoom-specific content (e.g., running PSX Doom discs) has been removed
- New structure emphasizes REAPER's custom content and development status
- Credits section properly acknowledges PsyDoom as the base engine

## Key Files
- **README.md**: Main project documentation (recently updated)
- **docs/TODO.TXT**: Current development tasks and priorities
- **docs/PROGRESS-LOG.MD**: Detailed log of changes and progress
- **CHANGELIST.md**: History of PsyDoom engine changes
- **CONTRIBUTORS.md**: Contributors to the PsyDoom engine

## Important Notes for Future Contexts
1. REAPER is NOT PsyDoom - it's a new game built on that engine
2. Follow C-FORM coding standards for all code changes
3. Always update TODO.TXT when completing tasks
4. Log progress in PROGRESS-LOG.MD instead of creating new docs
5. README.md should stay focused on REAPER, not PsyDoom features
